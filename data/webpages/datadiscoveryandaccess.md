# Data discovery and access

UVA Library provides a collection of data sources to support quantitative research. You can [learn more about finding data through various sources](https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/data) or [review licensed data sources](https://library.virginia.edu/data/datasources/licensed) available through the Library.

### Get help with data

Do you need help finding or accessing data for your research? Our Data Librarian can work with you to

* search for and locate existing data sources,
* access and use data sources, software tools, and online databases licensed by the Library,
* talk researchers through licensing proprietary datasets, and
* understand data documentation and codebooks.

Contact our Data Librarians at [data@virginia.edu](mailto:data@virginia.edu) for a consultation.

### Building the collections

You may also be interested in our [Data Collection Development Policy](https://library.virginia.edu/policies/data-collection-development-policy/), which governs the collection development and acquisition of data at UVA Library. Or, you can [recommend the Library purchase a dataset](https://library.virginia.edu/services/purchase-requests/).
