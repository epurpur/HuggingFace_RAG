# StatLab

The UVA Library StatLab provides free statistics consulting to students, instructors, faculty, and staff of the University of Virginia. We can help with the following:

* Statistical planning and sample size estimates
* Cleaning and wrangling data
* Implementing and interpreting a statistical analysis
* Data visualization
* One-on-one training on statistical software

To set up an appointment, email us: [statlab@virginia.edu](mailto:statlab@virginia.edu). We can work with you in person, over Zoom, or via email.

To help us help you, please describe your research goals and/or any specific questions you have. Keep in mind that it may take a few meetings to completely address certain questions.

We are most comfortable working in R, Stata, SPSS, SAS, and to a lesser extent, Python. Some of our Research Data Service colleagues have expertise in Tableau, Qualtrics, and Dedoose.

We also teach [free workshops](https://library.virginia.edu/data/training/), write [articles and tutorials](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/) on various statistical topics, and offer [a list of statistics resources](https://library.virginia.edu/data/statlab/statistics-resources) and [best practices for statistical analysis](https://library.virginia.edu/data/statlab/best-practices-for-statistical-data-analysis).

If you have found StatLab useful to your research, we hope you’ll [acknowledge us in your work](https://library.virginia.edu/data/statlab/acknowledgments).
