*Our policy is that we do not record live workshops in order to encourage robust Q&A. However, you can always find the full workshop materials for all of our workshops at: <https://library.virginia.edu/data/training/past-workshops> which allows you to work through the material at your own pace. We also encourage you to reach out to the instructor at any time for a one-on-one consult, and for specific or general questions about any of the topics we cover.*
