# Data management planning support

Are you writing a grant proposal? Most Federal and many private funding agencies now require a Data Management Plan (or DMP; also called a Data Management and Sharing Plan) as part of the proposal. **We can help with that!**We’ll walk you through the components of a DMP for your sponsoring agency and help you identify resources. Email us at [dmconsult@virginia.edu](mailto:dmconsult@virginia.edu) to get started.

Or try the [DMPTool](http://dmptool.org/), an online application that helps researchers create effective data management plans. The Data Management Plan Tool (DMPTool) provides an easy to use interface that:

* Helps users create ready-to-use data management plans for specific funding agencies
* Meets funder requirements for data management plans
* Provides step-by-step instructions and guidance for how to manage data
* Provides information about resources and services available at your institution to help fulfill the data management requirements of your grant

As a UVA DMPTool user, researchers use NetBadge and their UVA computing id to access the DMPTool. The tool provides links to local UVA resources for guidance and help while developing your DMP. Users of the DMPTool can view sample plans, preview funder requirements, and view the latest changes to their plans. The tool permits the user to create an editable document for submission to a funding agency and can accommodate different versions as funding requirements change.

Check our [Research Data Management guide](https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/RDM/planning) to learn more.

### DMPTool news

DMPTool updated to [version 5.0](https://blog.dmptool.org/2024/01/24/dmp-tool-5-0-release/) on January 24th, 2024. Updates in the new version include:

* **Infrastructure Improvements:** The Rails-based back-end is being updated, and a React-based front-end is being introduced. The goal is to support generation of the structured data necessary for machine-actionable DMPs.
* **Updated Homepage UI:** Key information about the application is more accessible and straightforward.
* **DMP Versioning:** New versions are created when registered DMPs are updated, ensuring that you can easily track and reference different iterations of a DMP.

Currently the DMPTool supports 296 institutions and more than 59,000 users worldwide. The new DMPTool retains all of the existing functionality plus some handy new things, all in a shiny new package:

* Up-to-date [funder requirements](https://dmptool.org/public_templates) [and DMP templates](https://dmptool.org/public_templates)
* A searchable list of [participating institutions](https://dmptool.org/public_orgs) with & without single sign-on
* [Quick-start guide for creating a DMP](https://dmptool.org/quick_start_guide)
* [General data management guidance](https://dmptool.org/general_guidance)
* [DMPTool Blog](https://blog.dmptool.org/) is the best way to find out about changes in the tool.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/CDLUC3/dmptool) is the home of the Roadmap-based version of the DMPTool.
